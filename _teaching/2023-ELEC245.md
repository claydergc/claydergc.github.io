This course is an introduction to mobile robotics and some algorithms used in artificial intelligence that allow robots to navigate autonomously. In this course, I teach direct and inverse kinematics of some wheeled robots, how to compute their wheel-based odometry. Then, I talk about some sensors such as stereo cameras, sonars and lidars and how process their data. In the second, I teach algorithms such as RANSAC, Artificial Potential Fields and an introduction to the Kalman Filter.
